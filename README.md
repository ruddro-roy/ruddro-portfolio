# Satellite Tracking & Threat Analysis Platform

## Real-time Space Situational Awareness System

A comprehensive satellite tracking platform that provides real-time orbital mechanics visualization, threat assessment capabilities, and autonomous monitoring of space objects. Built to advance space situational awareness and contribute to the growing need for space traffic management.

## What This Project Achieves

This platform addresses critical challenges in space domain awareness by providing:

- **Real-time Tracking**: Precise orbital propagation for 20,000+ space objects using SGP4/Skyfield algorithms
- **Threat Assessment**: Autonomous analysis of conjunction risks and space debris threats
- **Regional Predictions**: Pass prediction algorithms for ground-based observation planning
- **Autonomous Operations**: Self-healing systems with intelligent data acquisition and processing
- **Secure Architecture**: Cloud-native design with zero-trust security principles

The system contributes to advancing space safety through improved tracking accuracy, automated threat detection, and accessible visualization tools that can inform future space traffic management systems.

## Architecture

### Microservices Design
- **Gateway Service**: Node.js/TypeScript with Express, JWT authentication, rate limiting
- **Orbit Service**: Python/Flask with Skyfield for precise celestial mechanics calculations  
- **Visualization Frontend**: React with CesiumJS for real-time 3D Earth rendering
- **Data Layer**: MongoDB Atlas for persistence, Redis Cloud for caching

### Cloud Infrastructure
- **Containerized**: Docker containers with Kubernetes orchestration support
- **CI/CD Ready**: GitHub Actions workflows for automated deployment
- **Environment Agnostic**: Deploy on AWS, GCP, Azure, or Render with environment variables
- **Auto-scaling**: Horizontal scaling based on tracking load and user demand

## Technical Innovation

### Autonomous Data Management
- **Smart Token Rotation**: Automatic API key management without manual intervention
- **Self-healing Systems**: Automatic failover and service recovery
- **Intelligent Caching**: ML-based cache optimization for orbital data
- **Dynamic Rate Limiting**: Adaptive throttling based on real-time API health

### Security Features
- **Zero-trust Architecture**: All communications authenticated and encrypted
- **Token Isolation**: Sensitive credentials never exposed to client-side code
- **IP Whitelisting**: Configurable access control for sensitive operations
- **Secure Proxy Layer**: Isolated token management for external APIs

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+ (for local development)
- Python 3.9+ (for orbit microservice)

### Instant Deployment
```bash
# Clone and deploy
git clone https://github.com/ruddro-roy/satellite-tracking-platform
cd satellite-tracking-platform
docker-compose up --build
```

### Environment Configuration
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

The platform will automatically handle API authentication and service orchestration.

## Real-world Impact
